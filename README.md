# Fibonacci_Number_Exercise
 Created for an internship opportunity :)

 Instructions:
 The game is played by clicking on one of three doors in every room.
 
 Design choices:
 I was tasked with creating a fibonacci sequence visual representation. The assignment also said to be creative, so creative I became. I thought a quiz would be fun, kind of like how a child learns simple math in an online flash game. Then I remembered a coop minigame from Wii Party where you choose doors at random in order to meet each other in one of the rooms. I thought it would be interesting to combine these concepts to create a fun education game.
 
 This design gave me a fun new programming concept to work with: "pooling". I didn't want to make a very long sequence of rooms, so instead I opted for making two sets of rooms and hallways that get pasted one after the other, creating the illusion of an infinitely long sequence of rooms. I had never done this before, but it sure was fun finding out the optimal solution, and I believe I did quite well.
 
 Please be sure to take a look at it in the editor, because it looks interesting on the outside with all the rooms being pasted one after the other.
